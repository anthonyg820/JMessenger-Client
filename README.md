# JMessenger-Client
JMessenger Client is the GUI for your local chat. This software must be ran alongside the JMessenger Server application in order to function properly.

JMessenger is an Intranet chatroom! This means it runs locally and can only be seen and used by people connected to the same WiFi network as you. This is perfect for homes and small businesses looking for a free way to communicate with multiple people in a manner similar to that of Skype.

- Alerts when a user enters and leaves the chat
- Implements a Night Mode feature
- Allows users to customize the font style and size

Upcoming Features
- Allow images to be sent in chats
- Separate 'chat rooms' for different guest combinations
- Encrypted chat rooms (requiring password authentication before entering)

- Possible internet-based version

Usage Instructions
1) Download JMessenger Server on the computer you wish to be the chat host.
2) Download JMessenger Client on all computers that you'd like to have chat cabability
3) Run the server program first. Then run client program. And you're ready to go!
